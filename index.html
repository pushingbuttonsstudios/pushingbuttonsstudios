            <p class="production-logline">Girls Will Be Girls (2024) is a poignant coming-of-age drama directed by Shuchi Talati and marks the maiden venture of Pushing Buttons Studios. The film sensitively explores a teenage girl's awakening and the emotional echoes it stirs in her mother. Since its world premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, it has won two major Sundance awards—Audience Award for World Cinema Dramatic and Special Jury Award for Acting (Preeti Panigrahi)—and swept four top honors at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival, including the NETPAC Award, Young Critics Choice, Film Critics Guild Gender Sensitivity Award, and Jury Special Mention. Its remarkable journey culminated in a historic win at the 2025 Independent Spirit Awards, where it became the first Indian film to receive the prestigious John Cassavetes Award.
